The widespread use of rice throughout the Mediterranean basin is considered to be due to the Arab culture, however some archaeological evidence has been found which dates the use of rice as even earlier, in 630 B.C. It would appear that rice was one of the goods which was traded in the spice markets of Alexandria, although\u000d\u000ait was considerably less valuable than pepper. As far as Italy is concerned, there are several possiblities. Some say it came from the Arabs who ruled Sicily for so long, while others believe it was the Venetian merchants, who had many dealings with their Eastern counterparts. Perhaps rice was brought home by crusaders, after having fought against Islam in the Holy Wars, or maybe it was the Benedictine monks who established sea harbour\u000d\u000ahealth care centres. Whichever route it came by, a book of household accounts of the Dukes of Savoia in Piedmont, Northern Italy in 1300, records an expense of 13 imperials for the buying of rice for making desserts. In the 15th Century rice is mentioned in a letter written by the Duke of Milan and by the 16th Century the entire great city of Milan was surrounded by rice fields, the sunlight glinting off their network of canals.\u000d\u000aCarnaroli is considered one of the best of Italian rice varieties, and is well known for holding its texture and not overcooking. It is used for very special risotto and is good enough to be partnered with the most luxurious ingredients. Vialone Nano has a small, fat, very hard grain. Traditionally, it has been the rice preferred by the Venetians and by the people of Mantova. It gives excellent results, but is quite different to the other two.\u000d\u000a","EACH LITTLE PLANT contains 100 to 200 grains of rice. It is a cereal, and like all cereals is made up of starch, which is essentially a carbohydrate. This makes it very nourishing, as it is packed with proteins, vitamins, minerals and fibre, as well as being easily digested.However ,unlike other cereals, rice contains no gluten,making it ideal for celiacs and sufferers of wheat intolerance. ALONG WITH OTHER GRAINS, rice appeared on our planet approximately ten thousand years ago, when the great glaciers melted away to leave huge marshy areas in those parts of the world which are now India, Thailand and China. It could be said that since then, rice has been the staple food for three-quarters of the world\u2019s population. From China to Japan, passing through India and Indonesia, rice is more than just food \u2013 it is part of the culture and civilisation of these countries. Amongst other things, rice is considered to be a gift from the gods, a symbol of fertility and life. This symbolism is also present amongst Mediterranean cultures, where rice is thrown over newlyweds to wish them well. It was probably Alexander the Great, after the conquest of India in 350 B.C. who brought rice to the IN THE CENTURIES which followed, rice growing in Northern Italy expanded all over Lombardy, Piedmont and the Veneto, with vast expanses of rice fields, criss \u2013 crossed by an efficient irrigation system of canals and tiny locks. As a result, Italy is the largest producer of rice in Europe, with nearly a ton and half of rice produced every year, from the cultivation of two hundred and fifty thousand hectares. Ninety five percent of rice is grown in the three regions already mentioned, but a small amountis also grown in the wetter areas of Emilia-Romagna, Tuscany, Sardinia and Calabria.\u000d\u000aIn the Philippines, over ten thousand different kinds of rice have been recorded, of which five thousand are cultivated. This is in sharp\u000d\u000acontrast to Italy, where there are fifty different cultivated varieties of rice. Of these, Arborio, Carnaroli and Vialone Nano are the most\u000d\u000awidely available and all three are suitable for making the great rice dish of Italy: risotto. Arborio has a big fat grain and is ideal for all risotto. Being very rich in starch it makes for a very creamy finish. TRADITION & CULTURE\u000d\u000aWHAT IS RICE?

Hyppocrates would urge the ancient Olympians to nourish themselves both before and after competing, with a mixture of various cooked grains called \u00ebptasane\u00ed, enriched with a blend of water and honey. This is not a million miles away from what modern day athletes choose to eat when they prepare for competitions. It is a scientific fact that rice, and other carbohydrates can correct the lack of essential vitamins and minerals caused by eating too many processed foods, that are everywhere in our modern-day diet. Rice contains plenty of vitamins of the B group, as well as vitamin E and vitamin PP, and as far as its mineral content rice contains calcium, copper, iron, manganese, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, selenium and zinc.
